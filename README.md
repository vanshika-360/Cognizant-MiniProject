# Cognizant-MiniProject

Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to automate a web scenario using JavaScript Executor in a Selenium-based framework. The scenario involves registering a user on a website, filling out a form with personal details, and handling alerts. The project will demonstrate various Selenium concepts, including page navigation, form registration, reusable method creation, alert handling, exception handling, synchronization, and test case validation.

Implementation Guidelines 
1. Implement resuable methods separately to improve more readability.
2. Multibrowser execution-handle at least two browsers(Firefox and IE/Chrome). Optional-desired capabilities/driver setup.
3. Data driven concept
4. Handle exceptions with exception handling & error messages
5. Use relative path
6. Used ID or Name locator instead of XPath.
7. Coding started should be followed, which includes variable, object naming convention, script headers & comments
8. All scripts / business components/Test results should be available in their respective folders
9. Functions should have header, comments wherever applicable to improve readability and maintainability
10. Handle page synchronization issues using industry standard best practices. UseTimeout instead of Sleep statement wherever applicable.
11. Validation messages should be logged into the Test Results or Console output
